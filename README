The goal of this is to provide an empty, stub project that works out of the box for Tornado.

Instructions:

1) Install Tornado and its pre-requisits
2) Clone this app
3) ./project.py -c

You'd want to rename the dirs, set the variables in project.py and you should be good to go. It doesn't have authentication or user sessions on purpose but I may add that at some point. 

I found I was doing the same things with each tornado app, so I figured why not make the base stub.  Enjoy!
